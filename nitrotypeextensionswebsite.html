    <p>This extension is great! This displays your stats while you race. So if you are too lazy, like me, to look at your race results page theh this script is for you. This will show your seesion races, your lifetime races and your average speed. This is ectremely helpful if you are trying to get to a certain amount of lifetime races but you dont want to go all the way back to your stats. One flaw though if you use the auto reload extension or script that I will talk about later, then the stats on the race page doesnt update all the time. So for that reason, 7/10</p>

    <p>This extension will alow you to see the biggest word in the text. This is very helpful when going for a session or just getting a competitive advantage. This will help you finish races faster that your opponet so you will get more cash. 7/10<p>

    <p>This script allows you to complete races faster. This is espicially good for grinding when you are trying to just get races done quicky. So how it works is when you finsih each and every race it will quickly log you into a new race. Whenever you type the last letter of the race it automatically logs you into a new race. 10/10<p>

    <center><p>This gived you most of the cars but you are not able to use them. It is a nice flex to use on your friends or people in discord.But there is no advantage you gain from this script. So for that reason. 5/10<p></center>
